# Resume-Categorization
I designed an NLP code utilizing a deep learning architecture, using two datasets for training the model's architecture.

For Dataset 01, sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snehaanbhawal/resume-dataset, my code halted its learning process at epoch 07 due to the implementation of the Early Stopping Callback. At the end of the learning process, it achieved a training accuracy of 97.47% and a validation accuracy of 71.05%. Subsequent evaluation on unseen data resulted in an accuracy of 72.12%.

Moving on to Dataset 02, acquired from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhainjeamita/updatedresumedataset, the same code ceased its learning at epoch 18 due to the Early Stopping Callback. By the end of this learning phase, the model achieved an impressive training accuracy of 100% and a validation accuracy of 97.22%. Evaluation on previously unseen test data showcased an extraordinary 100% accuracy. Though the total support for evaluating the model was 145. Even then it is really an impressive result.


Note : Here, I could not upload any of the trained models I saved in the code due to their large size of over 50 MB each.
